//1. interpolation does not change the value of either of the things being interpolated, concatenation does?
//2. Don't Repeat Yourself. Loops and functions.
//3. Declaring a variable allocates memory for it and registers it as existing. Assigning a value changes what goes in that memory.
//4. We should use let when we need to change the value of a variable, and otherwise use const
//5. A directory containing one or more child directories.
//6. type -help after the command
//7. it autocompletes parts of folder or file names, and certain commands in some cases. It lets you type less,
//which means less time spent and more importantly fewer typos.

//Boolean expressions questions
//1. <
//2. >
//3. ===
//4. +, ==
//5. *, ==
//6. !=
//7. ==

//While loops questions
//1. infinite
//2. code won't execute at all so it's not infinite
//3. code will output a string containing the letter "A" 20 times

//Loops questions, part 4
//1. While loops execute until a condition is met, for loops execute
//a defined number of times and use an index variable
//2.
for (let i = 0; i <1000; i++){
  console.log(i);
}
//3. definition, condition, iterator
//4.
for (let i = 999; i>-1; i--){
  console.log(i);
}
//5.
for (i = 1; 1 <11; 1++){
  consolge.log("The value of i is: " + i);
}
